AI-Powered Flood Prediction & Relief Coordination System 🌊🤖

An end-to-end AI and software solution for predicting floods and coordinating relief efforts, built with deep learning, Flask, and interactive dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview

Floods are not just a natural disaster—they are a challenge in data analysis, coordination, and timely response. This project demonstrates how AI, software engineering, and data science can be applied to directly support disaster management and relief efforts.

Key highlights:

Predicts flood severity (Low / Moderate / Severe) using a CNN with attention mechanisms

Recommends relief resources: food, shelter, medical aid, boats

Role-based dashboards for Citizens, Admins, and Relief Teams

Full backend with Flask APIs, persistent storage (SQLite), and real-time data access

Interactive frontend dashboards with dynamic visualizations
